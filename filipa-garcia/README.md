# Bakckend Engineering Challenge Solution
_by Filipa Garcia_

### Libraries Needed
All the libraries used in this project you will most probably already have installed. If not, please run the lines:
```
pip install json
pip install click
```

To run the code open a command line to this folder.
```
python main.py
```
If you run it this way, the script will use the default parameters.

You can change 3 parameters as seen bellow.
```
python main.py --input_file events.json --window_size 10 
--output_file new_report.json
```

Thank you for this challenge!
